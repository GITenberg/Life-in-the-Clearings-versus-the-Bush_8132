description: Written as a sequel to her groundbreaking memoir <Roughing it in the
  Bush</, Susanna Moodie's <Life in the Clearings Versus the Bush</ candidly explores
  the communities that developed along Lake Ontario in the 1850s. Based on her experiences
  of living in Belleville, Ontario, Moodie utilizes her sharp wit and observant eye
  to create a vivid imagining of society life in mid-nineteenth century Canada.</
  Moving from Belleville to Niagara Falls, <Life in the Clearings</ illustrated for
  Moodie's native British reader the sophistication of life in the clearings, which
  was in direct opposition to the harsh experiences detailed in her previous narratives
  about living in the Canadian backwoods.</ HarperPerennialClassics brings great works
  of literature to life in digital format, upholding the highest standards in ebook
  production and celebrating reading in all its forms. Look for more titles in the
